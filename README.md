Many people prefer cafes and restaurants both for socializing and eating and beverage
consumption with their relatives. People lose their time by reaching the waiter 
to order and touching physical menus after sitting in cafes or restaurants. 
This situation causes loss of money for cafes and restaurants and time loss for customers. 
Tara Gelsin ordering system is one of the applications that aims to eliminate 
this waste of time and money. This app offers QR-Code ordering system for cafes and restaurants.
